Quick demo: a small top-down shooter you can run locally.

Usage:

- Open `index.html` in a browser (modern Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
- Controls: **W A S D** or **arrow keys** to move; aim with mouse; hold left mouse to shoot.
- Click the canvas after Game Over to restart.

Files added:

- `index.html` — game canvas and scripts
- `style.css` — minimal styles
- `game.js` — game logic (movement, aiming, shooting, enemies)

If you'd like I can add keyboard shooting, sound, or build a static demo you can host on GitHub Pages.
